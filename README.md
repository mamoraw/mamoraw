# Hi, I'm Max! 👋

I am an analytical and logical-thinking Software Developer who loves learning new things. 

Currently, I am working on various projects focused on the design and implementation of RESTful APIs in conjunction with SQL databases. 

My repositories reflect my programming journey, from my very first steps to where I am now.
